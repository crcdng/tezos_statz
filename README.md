# Tezos Statz Demo

![](docs/ui.png)

A demonstration app written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) that allows to view [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain data (balance and list of transactions). On Android and iOS it includes a QR code scanner to scan the Tezos address. 

Tezos Statz Demo calls the TzPro REST API (formerly TzStats) provided by Blockwatch https://blockwatch.cc/.

The TzPro API is documented here: https://docs.tzpro.io/. It requires an API key from Blockwatch that you can get for free here: https://tzpro.io/. When you generate the key, klick the "Edit" button and look for a field called "HMAC Secret". Delete the contents of that field and click "Save".

## How to run the code

This repository contains only the source code. You have to build the app yourself. Get Flutter here https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install. Clone this repository and run `flutter create .` or add the target platforms (e.g. Web, iOS, Android, Mac) in your code editor. 

The API key is provided via an environment variable. Run your app with:

```
flutter run --dart-define TZPRO_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

More info about handling API keys in Flutter, obfuscation and other issues: https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-api-keys-dart-define-env-files/ as well as https://docs.tzpro.io/intro/access for securing API keys in general. Make sure you understand the implications of API key management, especially if you are not on the free API tier.

If you deploy to macOS, you need to edit both `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and ` macos/Runner/Release.entitlements` and add the following key:

```
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

If you deploy to Android, you need to edit `AndroidManifest.xml` as shown:

```
<manifest xmlns:android...>
 ...
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 <application ...
</manifest>
```

If you deploy to iOS, you need to edit `iOS/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following key for the QR Code scanner to work:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to scan QR codes of Tezos addresses.</string>
```
